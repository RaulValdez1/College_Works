*Compilation of relevant works carried out during my university courses.*

Hi everyone! My name is Raúl Valdez from Guadalajara, México. I have a Master's Degree in Business Analytics and a Bachelor's Degree in Actuarial Sciences. In this repository you will find some of my works and projects developed during my academic career.

Currently I work in the Insurance Industry as a Business Insurance advisor and administrator, in behalf of our insurance agents. Although I enjoy working in this environment, I would like leverage my knowledge and habilites in the manipulation, representation and modeling of data. For that, I would like to explore a career in Data Science and Data Analytics.

Through my academic career I have worked with programming languages such as Python, R, VBA, Stata and SPSS. According with the situation, each of those would help me solve the problem at hand, from trivial data visualization to complex data modeling.

I hope this repository gives you an idea of my experience and skills working with data.
